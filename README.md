## song_recommender repo:
This Python repository will output a given number of recommended songs based on an inputted song by a given artist. 
If desired, it will also send you a text message (via Amazon SNS) with your recommended songs.

## Why this was created:
Like many other people, I have a select few songs I listen to on repeat until they get old. When this happens, typically Spotify recommends other similar artists. Sometimes, these new playlists have a couple new songs I enjoy, but most of the time, I forget about these recommended songs within a few minutes or skip the songs completely. I wanted to write code that ONLY gave me recommended songs based on a singular song that I know I love rather than an entire artist's collection of music. Hopefully, this repository will also benefit other avid music-lovers who want to expand their libraries to include songs that are extremely similar to the songs they love!
